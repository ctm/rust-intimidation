### History

I gave this presentation at the
[Google Developer's Group meeting on November 2nd](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-albuquerque-presents-november-tech-presentations-oniells-nob-hill/). 
In theory, I had a forty-five minute block of time. My plan was to spend about twenty minutes rushing through the
slides and then spending the remaining time visiting whatever source code the attendants wanted to
look at. However, due to some poor choices I made, I started late and didn't monitor my time, 
which resulted in us not looking at much code at all, which I know was a disappointment for some in attendance.

### Notes

Although this deck _may_ have links and ideas useful to people who didn't attend my presentation,
the presentation itself was not just reading the bullet points on each slide. Instead, there
were supposed to be short &lt;cough/&gt; stories associated with each that put them in the context
of why Rust is great for some things but can be intimidating. 

For example, if read standalone, it might appear that I'm claiming
Victor Wooten is Rust programmer. He very well may be, however, he's in my deck as an illustration of someone who is
immensely talented and ridiculously humble and gives back a huge amount to the community. The Rust community is
overflowing with such people.

Oh, and I did explicitly mention that I wrote the easy parts of Executor and
that all the hard parts were written by others.
